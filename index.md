Did you know that there is a career track with the job title _[Research Software Engineer](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7994286)_? Well, if you are not already one, you could **become one**!

You can find here some _very good_ resources on teaching and learning RSE skills. Examples include:

- Which university programs could I attend to study and become a professional RSE?
- Which coherent online courses could I follow to build up skills from the set defined in the [RSE Competencies](competencies)?
- What material can I reuse for teaching my students about RSE skills?

We aim for original and extensive resources, targetting both general-purpose RSEs, as well as RSE specializations.
